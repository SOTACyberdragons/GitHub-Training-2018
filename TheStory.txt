Mr. Simons and The Squirrel: A Short Story

Once upon a time, there was a man who convinced the others to call him
Mr. Simons. He was a kind man, especially to those he hasn't killed yet. He
was especially kind to the love of his life: The Squirrel.

One day, Mr. Simons found the Squirrel dead. 

Mr. Simons was so sad he started to cry. Mr. Simons gave the Squirrel a proper burial. And was very remorseful.
